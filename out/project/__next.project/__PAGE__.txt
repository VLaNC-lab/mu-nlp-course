2:T43e,The application of graph neural networks (GNNs) in predicting missing attributes of products on e-commerce platforms addresses a pertinent challenge in online retail. Traditional methods like LLMs often struggle with training efficiency and fail to adequately capture the intricate relationships between various entities in product catalogs. GNNs, on the other hand, excel in modeling complex relational data structures by directly incorporating graph structures into their architecture. By leveraging the inherent connections between products, attributes, and user interactions, GNNs offer a more effective approach to predict missing attributes while reducing the computational overhead associated with training. Additionally, their ability to embed relationships between entities facilitates more accurate predictions and enhances the overall user experience on e-commerce platforms. This approach not only improves prediction accuracy but also mitigates the carbon footprint associated with inefficient training methods, aligning with sustainability goals in technology development.0:{"buildId":"QMBJtO0dJHoPVsYttbx0N","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"mx-auto max-w-6xl px-4 py-10","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-h1 font-semibold tracking-tight","children":"Projects"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl leading-relaxed","children":"A snapshot of the lab's ongoing research themes.

10:T46d,Video moment retrieval, leveraging the latest advancements in deep learning, presents promising avenues for efficiently accessing specific segments within large video archives. Contemporary methods typically employ deep neural networks to learn discriminative features from both visual and temporal cues, enabling accurate moment retrieval based on user queries. However, despite the progress, several challenges persist. One significant issue lies in the scalability and efficiency of these models, particularly when dealing with extensive video datasets. The computational burden associated with processing and analyzing such vast amounts of data can hinder real-time performance and scalability. Additionally, achieving robustness to various visual and temporal variations remains a considerable challenge. Factors such as illumination changes, occlusions, and complex motion patterns can significantly impact retrieval accuracy. Addressing these challenges is paramount for advancing video moment retrieval systems and unlocking their full potential in applications ranging from video summarization to content-based video search.11:T46d,Video moment retrieval, leveraging the latest advancements in deep learning, presents promising avenues for efficiently accessing specific segments within large video archives.
